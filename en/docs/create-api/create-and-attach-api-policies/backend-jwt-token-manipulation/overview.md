# Passing End User Attributes to the Backend

There can be scenarios where a backend service needs to make different decisions or respond with different data, depending on the application end-user that consumes an API. To achieve this, the backend service needs to have access to the respective end-user's data at the time an API call takes place.

This can be facilitated by the Gateway by sending the end user attributes that are defined in the respective user store, in a JWT via an HTTP header, to the backend service when the API call is being forwarded.

The backend JSON Web Token (JWT) contains the claims that are transferred between two parties, such as the end-user and the backend. A claim is an attribute of the user that is mapped to the underlying user store. A set of claims is referred to as a dialect.

If you enable backend JWT generation in the Gateway, each API request will carry a digitally signed JWT, which is in the following format to the backend service.

`{token header}.{claims list}.{signature}`

You can configure backend JWT in two ways.
