In APK, you can deploy APIs by using Kubernetes resources, if you prefer a Kubernetes-native experience. However, APK offers a suite of developer tools to streamline the API development process and use these tools to create and deploy APIs.

- <a href="../create-and-deploy-apis/create-api-using-cr" target="_blank">Kubernetes Native API Creation flow</a> - WSO2 APK support for the developer flow with direct Custom Resource (CR) creation, in alignment with the Kubernetes Gateway API specification.This method requires manually defining the API by creating YAML files for Kubernetes resources such as APIs, HTTPRoutes, Deployments, Services, ..etc, giving you complete control over the deployment but requiring some knowledge of Kubernetes.

- <a href="../create-and-deploy-apis/create-api-using-enhanced-flow" target="_blank">Enhanced API Development flow</a> - WSO2 APK provides a set of REST APIs and tools to streamline the API development process. These APIs/tools are designed for API developers to create APIs, mock APIs, and test APIs and deploying APIs to a Kubernetes cluster.
