# gRPC APIs

gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It was initially developed by Google and is now a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an incubating project.

You can use proto files to design a gRPC API in WSO2 APK, similar to developing REST APIs using OpenAPI Specifications (a.k.a. Swagger Definitions). WSO2 APK supports the creation of gRPC APIs with any number of .proto files as the API definition in two ways.

1. [Via REST API](create-grpc-api-using-rest-api.md)
2. [Via CRs](create-grpc-api-using-crs.md)
