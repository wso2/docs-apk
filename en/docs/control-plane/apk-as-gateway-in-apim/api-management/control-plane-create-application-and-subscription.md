1. Login to the Developer Portal ([https://am.wso2.com/devportal](https://am.wso2.com/devportal)) of the WSO2 API Manager.
2. Click on the `Applications` tab and then use `ADD NEW APPLICATION` option.
3. Provide the information as given below and click `Save`.

     <html>
        <table>
        <th>Field</th><th>Value</th>
        <tr><td>Application Name</td><td>SampleServiceApp</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Per Token Quota</td><td>10PerMin</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Description</td><td>Sample Service Application</td></tr>
        </table>
     </html>

4. Click **Subscriptions** to subscribe to the created SampleService API.
5. Click **Production Keys** or **Sandbox Keys** based on the environment for which you need to generate keys.
   Let's assume that you are working in a production environment. Therefore, click **Production Keys**.
5. Click **Generate Keys** to create an application Access Token with relevant scopes.
6. To verify the Application and Subscription creation in the kubernetes gateway, execute the following command. You will see the status of the deployed application as follows once completed.

    ```bash
    kubectl get subscriptions -n apk
    kubectl get applications -n apk
    ```

!!! Important If you are expecting a high scale of subscriptions and applications in your deployment
      The database storage option is offered in APK for deployments with a high number of subscriptions and applications, especially for enterprise use cases. Because, by default, subscription and application-related data are stored as CRs (Custom Resources) in etcd. However, as the number of subscriptions and applications increases, it can lead to overutilization of etcd memory, subsequently degrading the performance of your API gateway. This degradation can impact the deployment, un-deployment, and update times ultimately affecting the reliability of applications and subscriptions.
      
      By opting for the database option offered in APK for deployments with high numbers of subscriptions and applications, you can mitigate issues related to etcd storage, such as memory overutilization and performance degradation. This ensures smoother deployment, undeployment, and update processes, ultimately enhancing the reliability of your applications and subscriptions.
