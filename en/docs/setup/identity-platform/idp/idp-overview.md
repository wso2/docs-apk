# Identity Providers

Identity Providers, which are also referred to as IdPs, store and manage digital identities. By default, Kubernetes Gateway supports an inbuilt non-production identity provider/token service, which is only meant for testing purposes. Kubernetes Gateway also supports third party IdPs, namely Asgardeo and Auth0.

!!!NOTE
    You will have to create a TokenIssuer in APK with the user's organization represented by your IdP before using a External Identity Provider. You can use the [Add Token Issuer](../../../develop-and-deploy-api/token-issuers/token-issuers.md) to create a new token issuer.

WSO2 Kubernetes Gateway integrates with IdPs to obtain a token to use the System APIs and also to login to the portal.
