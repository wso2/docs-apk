# What is WSO2 Kubernetes Gateway?

Cloud native API management is a way to manage and govern APIs in a more effective and efficient manner by leveraging the benefits of cloud computing. This involves using API management tools and practices that are natively integrated with cloud environments, such as Kubernetes. WSO2 APK is an API management platform that has been designed specifically for cloud environments. It is built on a microservices architecture that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage APIs with enhanced scalability and flexibility. With features like automatic failover and load balancing, our platform is highly available and can handle a large number of API requests without performance degradation. Additionally, WSO2 APK supports continuous delivery and deployment, allowing you to quickly and easily push updates to your API services. Our platform supports the entire API lifecycle, from API design and development to developer portal, API gateway, and marketplace capabilities. Furthermore, we have added key architectural features that are specifically designed for Kubernetes environments, including automatic API discovery and the ability to operate within Kubernetes namespaces and clusters, all without compromising security.

Following are some of the benefits of APK:
-  WSO2 APK is built as a cloud native solution, making it more scalable and better suited for cloud-based environments.
- With the ability to deploy on any Kubernetes-based infrastructure, WSO2 APK provides more flexibility and portability.
- The platform is designed to work seamlessly with DevOps tools and processes, enabling teams to rapidly develop and deploy APIs.
- APK platform is a 100% open source solution released under Apache 2.0 license which allows users to use it as they prefer.

Moreover, WSO2 APK is built with a microservices architecture that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage APIs more efficiently and with greater flexibility. Additionally, because the various components (including the developer portal, admin service, and publisher) are implemented as separate microservices, the platform supports customization and scaling without affecting the system as a whole. This design makes it possible to add or remove functions and update individual components with ease.


## Characteristics of APK
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale up and down based on demand, allowing them to handle large numbers of API requests without performance degradation.
- **High Availability (HA)**: Designed to be highly available, with features like automatic failover and load balancing to ensure that API services are always available to clients.
- **Elasticity**: Designed to be elastic, meaning that they can quickly and easily adapt to changes in demand and workload.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Built using a microservices architecture, which allows for more flexible and scalable deployment of API services.
- **Containerization**: Use containerization technologies to package and deploy product API services/ implementations in a cloud environment.
- **Continuous Delivery and Deployment**: Support continuous delivery and deployment, allowing developers to quickly and easily push updates to product.
