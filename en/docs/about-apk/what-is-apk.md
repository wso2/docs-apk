# What is APK?

Cloud native API management refers to the use of API management tools and practices that are designed to be natively integrated with cloud computing environments, such as Kubernetes. These tools and practices help organizations to manage and govern their APIs in a more effective and efficient way, leveraging the benefits of cloud computing such as scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Cloud native API management is also a way of designing, building, and deploying APIs in a cloud environment. There are several characteristics that are commonly associated with cloud native API management.

WSO2 APK, designed to help you build, deploy, and manage APIs in a cloud environment. Our platform is built on top of a microservices architecture and uses containerization technologies to ensure scalability and flexibility. With features like automatic failover and load balancing, our APK platform is designed to be highly available and able to handle large numbers of API requests without performance degradation. We've also added support for continuous delivery and deployment, so you can quickly and easily push updates to your API services.

## Some characteristics of APK

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale up and down based on demand, allowing them to handle large numbers of API requests without performance degradation.

- **High Availability (HA)**: Designed to be highly available, with features like automatic failover and load balancing to ensure that API services are always available to clients.

- **Elasticity**: Designed to be elastic, meaning that they can quickly and easily adapt to changes in demand and workload.

- **Microservices Architecture**: Built using a microservices architecture, which allows for more flexible and scalable deployment of API services.

- **Containerization**: Use containerization technologies to package and deploy product API services/ implementations in a cloud environment.

- **Continuous Delivery and Deployment**: Support continuous delivery and deployment, allowing developers to quickly and easily push updates to product.
