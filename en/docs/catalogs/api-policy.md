API policies are a powerful tool in WSO2 APK for enforcing business logic and modifying API requests and responses. You can attach policies at the API-level or operation-level, in either the request or response flow

Refer [Manage API Policy](../../create-api/create-and-attach-api-policies/api-policies-overview/) for more information on how to configure API Policy with API.
